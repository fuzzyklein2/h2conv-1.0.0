Your Hydrogen pattern files could not be imported by the very latest version of Hydrogen I have. Here's an example pattern file. Can you make yours conform to its standard, whatever that is?

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<drumkit_pattern xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://www.hydrogen-music.org/drumkit_pattern">
 <drumkit_name>GMRockKit</drumkit_name>
 <author>hydrogen</author>
 <license>undefined license</license>
 <pattern>
  <name>Pattern 1</name>
  <info></info>
  <category>not_categorized</category>
  <size>192</size>
  <denominator>4</denominator>
  <noteList/>
 </pattern>
</drumkit_pattern>

Sure thing â€” this example you posted is the newer Hydrogen pattern file XML format. Let me break down the key structure so I can help you convert or generate patterns that conform to this:
Essential points:

    Root element is <drumkit_pattern> with namespaces:

    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns="http://www.hydrogen-music.org/drumkit_pattern"

    Inside that:

        <drumkit_name> â€” the drumkit that this pattern is meant to use.

        <author> â€” the creator.

        <license> â€” plain text.

        <pattern> block:

            <name> â€” human-readable name.

            <info> â€” optional notes.

            <category> â€” usually "not_categorized" unless sorted.

            <size> â€” usually 192 for a 4/4 bar with 16th note resolution.

            <denominator> â€” time signature bottom number.

            <noteList> â€” this holds all the hits.

If you send me one of your older pattern files that didnâ€™t load, I can write a little Python script to:

    parse the old file,

    map it to this new structure,

    write out a conforming .h2pattern file.

ðŸ’¡ I can also write you a converter you can reuse for a folder full of patterns.

If you want, upload one of your old pattern files and Iâ€™ll show you the conversion!
Or if you want the Python script right away, let me know â€” I can mock one up too.

Just make a Python script to convert your default Hydrogen pattern format to the actual newest version, please.
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely â€” hereâ€™s a clean Python script that will read an old Hydrogen pattern file and write it out as the new format you posted.

This assumes the old format looks roughly like this:

<pattern>
  <name>Old Pattern Name</name>
  <size>192</size>
  <noteList>
    <note>
      <position>0</position>
      <velocity>100</velocity>
      <length>48</length>
      <instrument>1</instrument>
    </note>
    ...
  </noteList>
</pattern>

And converts it into this structure:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<drumkit_pattern xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://www.hydrogen-music.org/drumkit_pattern">
 <drumkit_name>YourDrumkit</drumkit_name>
 <author>YourName</author>
 <license>undefined license</license>
 <pattern>
  <name>Old Pattern Name</name>
  <info></info>
  <category>not_categorized</category>
  <size>192</size>
  <denominator>4</denominator>
  <noteList>
    ... notes ...
  </noteList>
 </pattern>
</drumkit_pattern>

Hereâ€™s the script:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def convert_hydrogen_pattern(old_file, new_file, drumkit_name="GMRockKit", author="hydrogen", license_text="undefined license"):
    # Parse old XML
    tree = ET.parse(old_file)
    old_root = tree.getroot()

    # Build new XML structure
    ET.register_namespace('', "http://www.hydrogen-music.org/drumkit_pattern")
    ET.register_namespace('xsi', "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance")
    new_root = ET.Element(
        "{http://www.hydrogen-music.org/drumkit_pattern}drumkit_pattern",
    )

    ET.SubElement(new_root, "drumkit_name").text = drumkit_name
    ET.SubElement(new_root, "author").text = author
    ET.SubElement(new_root, "license").text = license_text

    # Copy pattern data
    pattern_elem = ET.SubElement(new_root, "pattern")
    pattern_elem.append(old_root.find("name") or ET.Element("name"))
    pattern_elem.append(old_root.find("info") or ET.Element("info"))
    
    category_elem = ET.Element("category")
    category_elem.text = "not_categorized"
    pattern_elem.append(category_elem)

    pattern_elem.append(old_root.find("size") or ET.Element("size"))
    
    denominator_elem = ET.Element("denominator")
    denominator_elem.text = "4"
    pattern_elem.append(denominator_elem)

    note_list = old_root.find("noteList")
    if note_list is not None:
        pattern_elem.append(note_list)
    else:
        pattern_elem.append(ET.Element("noteList"))

    # Write new XML to file
    tree = ET.ElementTree(new_root)
    tree.write(new_file, encoding="UTF-8", xml_declaration=True)

    print(f"Converted: {old_file} -> {new_file}")

# Example usage:
convert_hydrogen_pattern("old_pattern.h2pattern", "converted_pattern.h2pattern")

ðŸ”¥ Notes:

    Replace "GMRockKit" and "hydrogen" with your real kit name and author.

    This script assumes the old file has name, size, and noteList.
    If your old format is very different, send me an example, and Iâ€™ll tweak it!

    You can batch this into a loop if you have a folder full of patterns.

If you want, I can write the batch version too. Want me to do that?
Or upload an old file so I can make sure this matches your case perfectly!

I'm past my limit for free uploads for a while, but we'll address that later. ;)
ChatGPT said:

Haha â€” no worries, I get it! Been there. When youâ€™re ready, just toss one over and Iâ€™ll help fine-tune the script for your exact files.

In the meantime, the script I gave you should cover typical Hydrogen patterns â€” especially if they follow the old plain <pattern> root layout. If you copy-paste one into a text editor and it's close to what I guessed, this script will do the trick.

When you're back in upload mode, just holler and weâ€™ll lock it in!
Also, if you want, I can help you write a batch converter that scans a whole directory and converts all .h2pattern files at once â€” would save a ton of time. Want me to sketch that out for you?
